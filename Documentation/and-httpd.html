<h2> About and-httpd</h2>

<p>
    <a href="#simple">Simple</a>. <a href="#fast">Fast</a>. <a href="#secure">Secure</a>.
</p>

<a id="simple"></a>
<h3>Simple</h3>
<p>
    <a href="#configurable">Configurable</a>. <a href="#rewrites">Rewrites</a>. <a href="#vhosts">Virtual hosts</a>.
</p>

<p>At it's simplest the webserver can be used from the command line like so:</p>

<pre>
% ./and-httpd foo-dir
[Sep 20 21:20:05]: READY [0.0.0.0@8008]: foo-dir/
</pre>

<p>...which will start mapping requests to files under the specified
"foo-dir" directory, using /etc/mime.types to specify the content-type of the
resources and also automatically serving compressed versions of the
resources if it is available as the resource name with ".gz" appended. Serving
"large files" happens by default, if the system supports them. And if you are
root you can use the --chroot option, which tries it's best to just work
(doing a bind mount for /dev/log when in a chroot).</p>

<p>And-httpd accepts connection froma "local controller", allow the user to
gracefully shutdown or take a list of the current network connections being
serviced.</p>

<p>And-httpd also comes with an "extra mime.types" file which can be loaded
providing content-type information for "non-standard" files like bittorrent,
x-icon and OpenDocument</p>

<a id="configurable"></a>
<h3>Configurable</h3>
<p> It allows you to easily create
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI">"cool URLs"</a>, by using
the per. file configuration files (which can also do most of the points desired
of the "content manager" in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/chips/">chips</a>).
For instance, content can be negotiated by having the following file at the
path in the request configuration directory:
</p>

<pre class="conf">
<span class="comment">; Negotiate language and content</span>
<span class="comment">; Ie. request is http://foo/bar.c and this file is at</span>
<span class="comment">;  /&lt;req-conf-dir&gt;/bar.c And-httpd will serve either</span>
<span class="comment">;  /&lt;docroot&gt;/bar.c as text/plain or /&lt;docroot&gt;/bar.c as text/html</span>
(<span class="namespace">org.and.httpd-conf-req-1.0</span>
  (negotiate-content-type (text/plain '') (text/html .html))
  (filename += &lt;content-type-extension&gt;))
</pre>

<p>...the per. request configuration can add Content-MD5, Content-Location, ETags (which will be honored in If-Match headers from clients) and more.</p>

<p>
And-httpd will also do a number of things automatically, like automatically
redirecting between directories and files or automatically redirecting
"ugly" requests. </p>

<a id="rewrites"></a>
<h3>Rewrites</h3>
<p>While the rewrite capabilities aren't as powerful as
<a href="http://www.modrewrite.com/">mod_rewrite</a>, they are <b>much</b>
easier to do correctly. For example the following is in the default
and-httpd.conf to remove extraneous trailing index.html in URLs:</p>
<pre class="conf">
<span class="comment">; Match http://localhost/index.html and redirect to http://localhost/</span>
(<span class="namespace">org.and.httpd-conf-main-1.0</span>
   match-request [path-end = / &lt;directory-filename&gt;]
     <span class="namespace">org.and.httpd-conf-req-1.0</span>
       Location: [limit &lt;path&gt;-end = &lt;directory-filename&gt;] ''
       <span class="return">return</span> 301)
</pre>

<p>...another somewhat common need is to redirect all requests to another URL,
which can be done like:
</p>

<pre class="conf">
<span class="comment">; Redirect all requests for the localhost IP to localhost</span>
(<span class="namespace">org.and.httpd-conf-main-1.0</span>
   match-request [hostname-eq 127.0.0.1]
     <span class="namespace">org.and.httpd-conf-req-1.0</span>
      (Location: = http://localhost &lt;url-path&gt;)
       <span class="return">return</span> 301)
</pre>

<a id="vhosts"></a>
<h3>Virtual hosts</h3>
<p>Another command problem is hosting multiple domains on the same computer,
this again can easily be accomplished even from the command line by doing:</p>

<pre>
% ./and-httpd --virtual-hosts foo-dir
[Sep 20 21:20:05]: READY [0.0.0.0@8008]: foo-dir/
</pre>

<p>...now requests for "/x/y/z" on the host foo.example.com will be served
via. the file "foo-dir/foo.example.com:8008/x/y/z"</p>

<p>And-httpd also comes with a few tools, including make_index.pl
(which can make an index.html file for a diven directory) and gzip-r.pl (which
will recursivly create compressed files for auto content-encoding to save
bandwidth). There is also a utility to convert the and-httpd syslog lines into
the apache-httpd style combined log format.</p>

<a id="fast"></a>
<h3>Fast</h3>
<p>And-httpd uses the following system capabilities to quickly do it's work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Event multiplexing using either traditional APIs like poll() or newer APIs
 like epoll.</li>
<li>Multi-process support, allowing it to scale with the number of CPUs it
has available.</li>
<li>Zero copy network output, using either sendfile or mmap.</li>
<li>TCP_CORK, to combine data as much as possible.</li>
<li>TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT, to minimize empty network connections.</li>
<li>posix_fadvise(), to speed up disk IO</li>
<li><a href="http://www.and.org/vstr/">Vstr</a>, to manage IO buffers.</li>
</ul>

<a id="secure"></a>
<h3>Secure</h3>
<p> Although written in C the code doesn't call any
 <a href="http://www.and.org/vstr/security">simplistic "C string" functions</a>,
 so it isn't possible to create buffer overflows even if there is a logic
problem. </p>
<pre>
% LC_ALL=C egrep '[^_.>a-zA-Z0-9](mem|rawmem|bcopy|bzero|bcmp|str(n?cpy|n?cat|n?cmp|coll|xfrm|n?dup|r?chr|c?spn|str|pbrk|tok|n?case|sep|verscmp|fry|_)|stpn?cpy|r?index[^.]|a?sn?printf|byte_)' src/*httpd*.c
%
</pre>
<p> Unlike most other httpd servers and-httpd places strict limits on the
number of nodes inside each header. Thus stopping exponential DOS attacks.
It will also, by default, do checks before doing automatic directory redirects
so it doesn't give away that empty directories exist
(Ie. http://example.com/foo will not redirect to http://example.com/foo/ if
that would just produce a 404 anyway). </p>

<p>While And-httpd can be configured to be more "compliant", it by default
will reject requests which have:</p>

<ul>
<li>When using virtual hosts a hostname that isn't specifically allowed (this
is actually encouraged by rfc2616)</li>
<li>Encoded / characters in the URL-path</li>
<li>Encoded . characters in the URL-path</li>
<li>The sequence /./ in the URL-path</li>
<li>The character / in the hostname</li>
<li>Range requests of more than a single byterange (this is just ignored,
and the rest of the request is processed)</li>
<li>PUT/POST methods</li>
<li>Any kind of payload (Ie. content-length on a request)</li>
<li>Any "extra" CR or LF characters in the hostname or URL-path. </li>
<li>Any whitespace in a header name.</li>
<li>Any repeating of headers that aren't allowed to be repeated.</li>
<li>A URL-path that ends in any of: .shtml ~ # .tmp .htaccess or .sconsign
(or their compressed versions)</li>
</ul>

<p>...while some of these might make it "non-compliant" with rfc2616, no real
world clients do any of the above things. </p>

<p>And-httpd can also be configured to reject TRACE methods, although that
does no real harm and so is left as a debugging aid.</p>

<p>And-httpd also has over 1.9MB of unit tests, which run from "make check"
testing a significant portion of the above features.</p>

<a id="secure-guarantee"></a>
<h3>Secure guarantee</h3>

<p>In fact I'm so sure that it is secure that I'm offering a
"security guarantee" of $500.</p>

<p>Obviously there are caveats:</p>

<ul>
<li>The guarantee is only that stable released versions of
And-httpd (0.99.x and then 1.0.x, currently) cannot be compromised so that an
attacker can execute arbitrary commands or read/write arbitrary data. For
instance DOS attacks aren't included in the guarantee (although I'm pretty
sure And-httpd is better than most in that regard the nature of network
connected servers is that they are open to DOS attacks at some level). </li>
<li>I only guarantee against remote attackers, so anything in the
configuration that couldn't be expected to be put there by a "reasonable person
who knows what they are doing" is not allowed (this is esp. true for
information leak attacks, if it's a configuration issue it's not my
problem). </li>
<li>You have to have the latest Vstr, socket_poll and timer_q libraries
installed. </li>
<li>The $500 is only available to the first person who provides a working
attack (I'll allow a couple of weeks for you to demonstrate something that works
like an attack you describe).</li>
</ul>

<p>...on the "positive" side:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can run And-httpd as root, Ie. not using drop-privs. </li>
<li>You can run And-httpd without using chroot. </li>
<li>You can run And-httpd without system defenses like exec-shield and
SELinux. </li>
</ul>

<p>...although, obviously, feel free to add those as extra security layers on
your servers. </p>

<h2> Unsorted info. </h2>
<pre>
    Design is a statemachine triggering off IO events, somewhat like thttpd and boa (among others).
     Simple tests with "ab" show it to be about twice as fast as thttpd-2.20c (note that thttpd doesn't support keep-alive, which gives and-httpd a significant advantage -- mainly due to usage of Vstr).

    Uses the following system utilities:
     socket filters
     IP binding

     includes init.d file, and allows "local controller" connections for soft
    restarts, status information etc.

    DOES NOT:
      Auto generate directory listings (see ex_dir_list2html in Vstr examples)

      SSI, or other file contents parsing (see ex_ssi in Vstr examples)

      Run programs (doesn't call exec at all, only calls fork() at startup
                    for MP systems).

      Call any i18n/gettext libc functions (will be fixed).

      Parse or honor the Accept-Charset header.

      Full date parser (not a problem, string matches work well).
