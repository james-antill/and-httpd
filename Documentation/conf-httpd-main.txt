.... Accept:
.... Accept-Language:
.. HTTP | http
... authorization | auth
 Set some authorization to be required for all requests served from this
profile.
 Eg. (auth basic-single realm 'text' token u:p)
 Would require the username of 'u' and the password of 'p', displaying the
context for the autorization or 'text'.
... strictness
.... headers | hdrs
..... allow-double | allow-dbl | allow-*2
 Allow headers that shouldn't be repeated, which And-httpd understands, to be
repeated. This is used in HTTP response splitting attacks, for instance.
..... allow-missing-length
 Allow Content headers (like Content-Type) without an associated
Content-Length header. There is no good reason to do this, and implies the
client is activley attacking or just stupid. However there do appear to be
a significant number of stupid clients. The default is still to disallow it.
..... allow-spaces
.... hostname | host
..... canonize | make-canonical
 Making a hostname canonical involves removing a "www." from the begining, if
there is one, and removing any '.' characters from the end of a hostname. The
later will often happen by stupid clients, due to the way DNS hostnames
are resolved.
..... validation
.... allow-HTTP/0.9
 This option allows the extremely old and deprecated HTTP/0.9 protocol. This is
currently enabled for "compatibility", because basically every webserver
allows it and it's extremely simple. However there is no problem with disabling
it.
.... allow-dot-directory | allow-dot-dir | allow-.-dir
 This option allows clients to send /./ as a path seperator, this means that
multiple urls will now point to the same resource. And it looks horrible.
.... allow-encoded-slash | allow-enc-/
 This option allows clients to send a '/' in encoded form, there is no reason to
do this and it means And-httpd has to search for the encoded and normal form
when looking for basenames etc. (so it will be slower).
 However some broken clients will encode anything that isn't just a letter or
number.
.... allow-encoded-dot | allow-enc-.
 This option allows clients to send a '.' in encoded form, there is no reason to
do this and it means And-httpd has to search for the encoded and normal form
when looking for extensions etc. (so it will be slower).
 However some broken clients will encode anything that isn't just a letter or
number.
.... error-406-not-acceptable | error-not-acceptable | error-406
 Normally And-httpd will send a 406 error response if the normal response is
not acceptable to the client (the client can specify that any response would
be, if it wishes). This ignores the client and sends the data anyway (some
broken clients actually expect this).
.... URL | url
..... remove-fragment
 Some broken clients will send badly formed URLs that include fragments,
this feature fixes that up.
..... remove-query
 Normally queries parameters and their data are passed through to the
filesystem request, this removes them.
... ETag:
.... <auto-dev-inode-size-mtime>
 Automatically generate an ETag, using the device; inode; size and mtime of
the file, for files that don't have one configured, by the time request
processing is finished.
 This does the same as <auto-inode-size-mtime>, but will also detect changes
where a symlink or a bind mount is used to change the file and both files have
the same inode, are the same size and were last modified in the same second.
 This shouldn't need to be used much.
.... <auto-inode-size-mtime>
 Automatically generate an ETag, using the inode; size and mtime of
the file, for files that don't have one configured, by the time request
processing is finished.
 This will detect changes within a second that create a new file, any changes
that take over a second and changes within a second to the same inode that
truncate and append data.
 This is And-httpd's default, and Apache-httpd's default.
.... <auto-size-mtime>
 Automatically generate an ETag, using the size and mtime of
the file, for files that don't have one configured, by the time request
processing is finished.
 This doesn't protect from the common atomic update operation of
write_tmp_file() and rename(), if two updates happen within a second (and the
file doesn't change in size).
 This is significant enough that unless you are running a server farm, where
the inodes numbers on each server will be different, then it's not worth it.
... text-plain-redirect
 Use very small text/plain redirects, instead of usable html files. Note that
currently redirects can't be customized or compressed, so this is the only
usable way to decrease their length. Also note that almost no browsers will
show the data for the redirect requests.
