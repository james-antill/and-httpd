 You can place arbitrary configuration files in this directory (must end in
".conf" and not start with '.') and they will be loaded in mostly
LC_ALL=C order after the main configuration file is loaded.

 The difference in sort order is that files starting with an _ are loaded before
all others ... this is because all the files that and-httpd ships in the conf.d
directory will start with an '_'.
